## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I learned more about css positioning and effective use of flexbox element. Though it was hard, I also learned how to use the @media query tag quite well.


### Continued development

I intend to continue honing my html and css skills. I don't know anything about JS but when I've fully mastered html and css, only then will I think of learning JS. I also intend to take on the Frontend mentor bootcamp programming course once I finish all the free html and css challenge for newbies.

### Useful resources

-   [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius)
-   [Example resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hsl.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand HSL color codes. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
-   I'd like to recommend the MDN site or w3schools for anybody involved in programming. They are really great.
